## Overview
Repository with my work on 42 programming school. 

Each project includes a PDF with the subject, which explains the objectives, restrictions and instructions to complete each one of them; along with a Readme file summarizing: brief instructions on how it works, starting and completion dates (if any) and the current status or grade achived.
